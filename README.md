# 6dj8 phono preamp

This is a project to build a 6DJ8 (ECC88) tube phono stage as inspired by RJM audio (phonoclone.com).  The 6DJ8 seems to be out of production, but still readily available.

Gain is quoted as 40 dB (vs groovewatt 45 dB).  The groovewatt writeup (http://diyaudioprojects.com/Tubes/RIAA-Phono-Preamp/) claims that 45 dB is enough to drive directly Oddblocks with a passive volume control.  In my system I like having the extra gain of the forewatt though the volume is normally set at about "2" with phono input.  Conclusion:  *probably* OK with no additional gain into a poddwatt (which is advertized as having higher gain than the original oddwatt).

## Power board:

IEC power input, fuse, switch, neon as in https://github.com/eshazen/6cy7-amp.  PT, chokes mounted on PCB also.  Single noval socket for 6CA4 (ceramic).  Two B+ outputs for two channels.

## Channel board (2):

Single tube (6DJ8/ECC88) per channel.  RCA inputs and outputs, plus GND.  Power connector.
