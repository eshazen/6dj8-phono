# 6dj8 phono preamp

This is a project to build a 6DJ8 (ECC88) tube phono stage as inspired by RJM audio (phonoclone.com).  The 6DJ8 seems to be out of production, but still readily available.

## Power board:

IEC power input, fuse, switch, neon as in https://github.com/eshazen/6cy7-amp.  PT, chokes mounted on PCB also.  Single noval socket for 6CA4 (ceramic).  Two B+ outputs for two channels.

## Channel board (2):

Single tube (6DJ8/ECC88) per channel.  RCA inputs and outputs, plus GND.  Power connector.

## Progress

*2021-05-01* - Schematics done for PS and amp.  Footprints done and DigiKey numbers on amp schematic, starting placement

*2021-05-02* - Finished amp layout, placement for PS.  Resized boards so the stack of 3 has the same footprint as the 6CY7 amp (7.5 x 15").
